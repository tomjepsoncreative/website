            <div class="col col-lg-9">
                <p class="accent-copy">A Nottingham-based big data company approached me to help them deepen
                    their knowledge of their customer’s needs to enhance the solutions they create. Although this ‘discovery
                    first’ approach was new to them as a business they understood that it could add value to both their output and to how their customers perceive them.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col col-lg-9">
                <p class="body-copy">Before planning the session, I consulted with the team to learn more about their
                    needs, what they expected as outcomes, the project specifics we'd be exploring, and the goals - as
                    they
                    understood them - that their customer had. With new information in hand, I agreed a ‘discovery
                    statement’ - the problem we’re looking to solve - with the team and set about planning a session to
                    validate it.</p>
                <p class="body-copy">As with any successful discovery workshop, an agenda of focussed, meaningful
                    activities was essential to engage the attendees and make them feel at ease with sharing in the
                    group setting. On this occasion there were 6 participants in the workshop; despite all the attendees
                    being familiar with each other, sharing openly in this format could be daunting. It's my job to put
                    the attendees at ease and get them into the mindset for an open discussion.

                        uncovering how
                        they’re working and what kind of challenges they’re facing; discovery adds a ‘why’ to the ‘what’
                        and
                        the ‘how’ of a solution. Finding out information early on helps you validate your decisions,
                        keeps
                        you on the right track, and ensures you’re spending your time and money on things which are
                        valuable
