<h3 class="standout standout--color">Design Sprint</h3>
<p class="copy">Nottingham-based life sciences startup PHARMASEAL approached me to facilitate a four-day Design Sprint to design a cornerstone feature of their clinical trial management product.</p>
<p class="copy">Working with Product Director Ricky Lakhani and his team, we unpacked the challenges PHARMASEAL were facing, explored their users' journey, and collaborated on a best-fit-for-launch design solution.</p>

<p class="quote-copy">Tom set about understanding our problem, our market fit, and set out a structure-yet-flexible approach to help us meet our goals. Working through a Design Sprint with Tom could not have been a more fun, productive and engaging experience.</p>

<!-- Tully -->

<h3 class="standout standout--color">UX Consultancy / Product Design</h3>
<p class="copy">I worked with Project Manager Jess Salisbury to design an end-to-end app concept for a new finance product. Translating existing high-level concepts and user flow, I created a wireframe prototype demonstrating the product’s intent and user journey to key stakeholders within and outside the business.</p>
<p class="copy">Following our project's completion the concept prototype aided Jess' team in successfully securing investment funding to move the product into the next phase of development.</p>

<p class="quote-copy">It was a pleasure working with Tom on our early-stage wireframes. He grasped the product concept and carved a clear path to the outcome we needed. Given we had a very short deadline, Tom’s ability to facilitate highly productive sessions was very much appreciated, and I had complete trust in him to take the project forward.</p>

<h3 class="standout standout--color">UX Workshops</h3>
<p class="copy">Spotlight's directors Tom and Tim initially approached me to help them better understand one of their key customers. As an engineering-led company, both directors understood that bringing user insight and real-world feedback into their could transform their processes for the better.</p>
<p class="copy">To date, we have run numerous discovery workshops and co-design sessions which have directly enhanced their software offer and delivered real value for their customers.</p>

<p class="quote-copy">Tom not only tried to understand what makes the project tick, but what makes us tick as individuals. It was very impressive. He has the ability to make everyone feel open and honest about their project. The sessions were tailored to our needs and really helped us to understand much more than we thought we knew initially.</p>
