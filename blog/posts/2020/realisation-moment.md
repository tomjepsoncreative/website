<!-- Excerpt Start -->
I make no bones out of the fact that I’ve made a career out of asking questions; I love it. Digging in and finding out stuff.

I was taking a walk a while ago and had a bit of an ‘Oh, s***!’ moment.<!-- Excerpt End -->


Listening to Todd Henry’s Accidental Creative podcast, the presenter was talking about how, when we work from a place of ego, we don’t do anything like our best work for our clients OR ourselves. This was quite profound when I started to dig into it. It was something I knew to be true and thought I was doing it. However, deep down I knew I’d been working from a place of ego almost my entire life.

When a client comes to me and says ‘Hey Tom, I want a website.’ my first move used to be:

> ‘OK, great. Thanks for talking to me. So… Why do you want a new website?’

The way I was framing this conversation starter was totally one-sided; it was a challenge to this approaching client who may want to drop some of their hard-earned into my pocket to convince me that the thing they want is the thing they need.

How absolutely backward does this sound?

I found myself becoming ever-more conscious about the way I started conversations and the way I opened the door to clients. Rather than leaping in with a straight ‘OK, why?’ I’ve adopted a much more exploratory approach.

> ‘OK, great! Thanks for taking the time to talk to me about it. How about we explore that a little and make sure that a new website is really the right thing to solve your problem.’

*It is not your clients’ job to convince you that the thing they want is the thing they need or that you should just go and make it for them.*

Asking an exploratory question or two upfront might feel a bit uncomfortable for both you and the person talking to you, especially if they ‘just want to know how much a website costs’. However, caring a little more and showing interest in their challenge does better for them, you, the work, and the people who end up using whatever it is you make.
