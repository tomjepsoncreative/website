<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Throughout our careers we'll be given advice; some will stick and some won't. One thing which has resonated with me for as long as I can remember is that, to achieve real success, you have to 'show up'. Being there whether we want to or not and putting in the time sets us apart from the pack and tees us up to succeed.<!-- Excerpt End -->

While this advice has threads of truth running through it - 'You have to be in it to win it' - what do we do on the days when we just *can't* 'show up'?

Looking after our mental health is one of the most important things we can do as humans; worrying that you're not going to make a success of yourself because you're constantly comparing yourself to those who are showing up day in day out can be pretty damaging.

Each of us is unique; we have our own struggles, superpowers, and capacities for pushing on through when the going gets tough. However you show up in your own way - on the days that you can and on the days that you can't - is OK.

It's worth acknowledging that you can't bring your A-game all the time. Don't compare yourself to other people; don't worry if they're showing up for 37 hours a day, 8 days a week. However you do what it is you do, that is enough.

Be kind to yourself. If you are not able to show up for right now, show up for later. Make a small step because, when you show up for real, the world is going to know about it!
