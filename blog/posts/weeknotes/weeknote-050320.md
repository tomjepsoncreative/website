A weeknote for w/c 3rd May 2020.<!-- Excerpt End -->

- Birthday! It was my birthday at the beginning of the week and, considering the current scenario is a bit of a cluster-fudge, it was a very relaxing day.
- I had no fewer than FIVE coaching conversation with people reaching out to me after I offered some free hours. It’s so great to learn about people’s journey and what they want to do with their careers and lives. I hope to do more soon.
- Planning has begun for the next stage of my business AND a potential new collaboration with a good friend
- Animal Crossing. That is all.
