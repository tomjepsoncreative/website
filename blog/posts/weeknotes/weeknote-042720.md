A weeknote for w/c 27th April 2020.<!-- Excerpt End -->

- Pre-birthday week! It was my 37th birthday on May 3rd. How on earth did that happen...
- I published TWO blog posts at the end of the week; one on disagreement and another recapping thoughts I’ve had over the last 12 months. It felt good to write and make proper efforts to finish the content.
- My current work contract has been pulled due to COVID-19. I feel fortunate that it’s carried on for as long as it has, however I now need to hunt for some new project work beginning in June (Did I mention I’ll be free from June 1st?)
- Exciting conversations have been happening on the Design Thinking front; without distracting myself from too many current ideas-in-play, conversations with a friend have yielded some new opportunity avenues.
- Horror movies have been a theme this week! Blood Car, The Rezort, and Starry Eyes so far... Each different; each engaging; each leaning into my questionable taste in films!
