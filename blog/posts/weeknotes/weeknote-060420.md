Weekly notes for w/c 6th April 2020.<!-- Excerpt End -->

- Busy with the current client work; getting stuck into practical UX work (and some creative UI design) has definitely been amiss in my projects over the last few months.
- Another week of lockdown and home-bound working: nobody has lost the plot... yet!
- It’s been a HUGE week for what was the Virtual Design Sprints Europe community. My co-founders and I have relaunched as [https://www.vdscollective.com](VDS Collective) to a strong, positive response from our networks. There’s plenty to come on from this story soon...
- We’ve been watching ‘Hunters’ on Amazon Prime. It’s gritty, quite silly, and Al Pacino is *great* - I can’t tell if the character was written around him or if he’s just brought his A-game and really levelled up the show. Either way; great stuff.

Onwards to another positive, productive week.
