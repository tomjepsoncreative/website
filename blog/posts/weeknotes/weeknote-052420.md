A weeknote for w/c 24th May 2020.<!-- Excerpt End -->

- It has been half-term in the UK which, while mostly no different from the current day to day routine, has been pleasant. It keeps the days from merging into one!
- My current client project came to its premature end. I am now back on the market, so to speak!
- The gamification workshop of 26th May was a huge success and has lit a fire under me to dive deep into how the concept could be used to improve how we work together; remote collaboration enhancements are very high on the agenda for many people right now.
- I saw the gameplay trailer for The Last of Us Part 2 and pre-ordered it instantly. The first game in the series was - at the time - the best game I had ever played. I have very high hopes for Part 2.
- VDSC (Virtual Design Sprint Collective, of which I am a co-founder) is picking up pace. New membership tiers have been opened for GVDS (Global Virtual Design Sprint) alumni to promote the community and maintain the pace of the world-wide online Sprint agenda. More on this soon.
