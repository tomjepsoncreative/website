A weeknote for w/c 31st May 2020.<!-- Excerpt End -->

- Back to running a business... I find something very comforting in a month beginning on a Monday. 1st June was a full-bore strategy day. It’s important to take the time to refocus yourself and remember why you’re doing the thing you do.
- Lead calls, pitches, and proposals are becoming a frequent thing. The to-and-fro dance between potential clients and I is nearly always invigorating and never not terrifying!
- We started watching ‘White Lines’ on Netflix.
- I’ve been listening to a LOT of Meshuggah in the last couple of weeks. A band I don’t listen to all that often, however they never get old. Killer technical metal.
- I started reading ‘Ego Is The Enemy’ by Ryan Holiday. I really enjoy Ryan’s writing and find his take on Stoic philosophy engaging and inspiring. Another great book to dip into from time to time when you need a little pick-me-up...
