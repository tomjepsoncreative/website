<!-- Excerpt Start -->
A weeknote for w/c 17th May 2020.<!-- Excerpt End -->

- A busy, busy, busy week for calls and meetings. Most have been a joy since they were all kicked off from referrals. The best kind of work. Two didn’t land and one quote is in; let’s see how the next week goes.
- Finished Narcos. Man, that show is just stunning.
- I’ve been amazed by the ‘new normal’ adaptations that I am seeing in a number of businesses. Office-free ‘til 2021... Permanent shifts to all-remote working... This is a massive opportunity for creative and tech workers everywhere.
- The ‘Gamification...’ workshop set for 26th May has 27 attendees with places booked. Best get the MURAL canvas made!

Onwards to another week. Stay home, stay safe, keep talking.
