<h1>Creative Coaching for UX Designers (and the people who work with them)</h1>
<p>Are you feeling adrift in your UX career and need a helping hand to set you on the right path? Do you ever feel like your work is 'stuck' in one place and you're approaching problems in the same way every time?</p>
<p>Are you struggling to communicate your work to your team or to stakeholders in a way which really brings them on side? Do you feel like your expertise and insights are being overlooked when it comes to collaborating with a team?</p>
<p>Are you looking for a fresh start as UX professional but don't know where to begin? The landscape for a new-starter can feel like an expanse with a great many ways to cross. How do you want to take your first steps?</p>
<h2>Who is it for?</h2>
<p>Since everyone has challenges unique to them, coaching sessions with me are not exclusively for designers.</p>
<p>If you're a UX designer in a junior or mid-level position and are fired up to jump into the next stage of your career, I can definitely help you.</p>
<p>If you work with designers - maybe you're a Product Manager or Development Leader - and want to get more out of those relationships, I can help you, too!</p>
<p>If you're thinking about taking your first role as a designer or maybe shifting your career to focus on UX, I'd love to talk to you.</p>
<h2>What is coaching?</h2>
<p>Coaching is 1:1 time spent with an expert; someone who has been in your shoes and has walked the same lines. It is about the here and now; the challenges you're facing that could block you from getting your next promotion or from landing a new client.</p>
<p>A valuable coaching session is about listening and understanding; making the most of the skills that you have, unlocking your potential, and guiding you to learn how to reach your aspirations and goals.</p>
<h2>Why coach with me?</h2>
<p>As a late-starting, self-taught designer who has 'come up' through the industry, I know what it is like to feel out of your depth or slightly adrift. I want to help you.</p>
<p>Using the experience I've gained over the last decade or more, I want to offer practical guidance on making a great start in your career, and positioning yourself to make the most of what you have right now. If I can help you avoid making some of the many daft mistakes I've made over the years I'll do that, too!</p>
<p>In my career I have lead and worked with designers, developers, product owners, marketers and more in a range of different industries; from startups like Biotaware and Buying Butler to corporate enterprises like Esendex and Experian. The experience I've gained working with this breadth of individuals has informed and shaped how I approach my UX consultancy today.</p>
<p>With every coachee I look to home in on the real challenges they are facing; helping them understand what's going on under the surface. Together we can identify what really matters and find ways for you to reach your goals. Let's travel that road.</p>
<h2>What are the sessions for?</h2>
<p>Coaching calls are used to talk about the challenges you're facing in your work or professional development; maybe you want to level up your UX skills, learn how to engage with your community more effectively, or find better ways to present yourself so your work really 'lands' when you need it to.</p>
<p>While I can't tell you what your challenges are, I can help you find them. Be ready to think about your journey and dig deep; I tend to ask a lot of questions!</p>
<h2>Testimonials</h2>
<p>&quot;I had a session with Tom on approaching my career in UX and product design. He really understands the subject; his questions were direct and made me think! I'm very grateful for his input and advice. I'd definitely recommend Tom!&quot;</p>
