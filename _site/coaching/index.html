The experience I've gained working with these individuals has informed and shaped how I approach my UX consultancy today.</p>
          <p class="copy">With every mentee and coachee, I look to dig into the real challenges they are facing; helping them understand what's going on under the surface. Together we can identify what really matters and find ways for you to reach your goals.</p>
