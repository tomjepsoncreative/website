  <time datetime="2020-10-29T00:00:00.000Z">October 29, 2020</time>
  <hr>
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>As I was making my coffee this morning I realised I have not shared anything to do with my recent journeys into product-making. <strong>I’d long ago posted about writing a course on setting up a remote workshop using MURAL</strong>; I never followed through and finished it.<!-- Excerpt End --></p>
<p>Excuses were made and production halted.</p>
<p>However, as we’re approaching the end of 2020 - a year of significant trauma, trial, and change - I wanted to ‘get back on the horse’ so to speak and revisit something about which I am passionate.</p>
<p>At the beginning of October I signed up for Christopher Murphy’s ‘Sell While You Sleep Course’ - party to satisfy my need to ‘do something’ to progress my own learning and also to support Chris as he makes his way in to a brand new career path as a school founder. After only 6 weeks of course material and with the support of my student peers and Chris as a mentor <strong>I have resurrected the workshopping course</strong>; it has transformed into something much greater, much more valuable, than I first imagined it could be.</p>
<p>In its current form I want to bring <strong>everything I have learned about workshops, facilitation, and engagement in the virtual space</strong>, presenting it in a way which is digestible, accessible, and - most importantly - easy to implement by anyone looking to learn.</p>
<p>It’s not ‘a course’ in the traditional sense but a means for me to share my experience with people who want it and need it. After all this year has given us, <strong>a fresh view on what is really possible with remote collaboration in our communities around the globe</strong> may be one of the finest gifts.</p>
<h2>Effective Virtual Workshops</h2>
<p>What I want to achieve with this new endeavour is to <strong>help people find their way of workshopping effectively</strong> in the virtual space. It’s all about creating an understanding of what’s possible with the tools people have at their disposal; how to use them to draw effective outcomes from any session regardless of someone's position in a company or their level of experience.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to corner a market for any particular style of session; there are agencies who have doubled-down on Design Sprints and Design Thinking.</p>
<p>I’m not looking to set up some proprietary method for ‘doing things better’ because I don’t believe that would be helpful; introducing new tools into people’s consciousness (and then trying to help them develop behaviours to create ‘stickiness’) is a surefire way to make a rod for my back.</p>
<h2>Refine All The Time</h2>
<p>In the coming days I am going to be taking the leanest version of The Remote Workshop Guide I can and getting it ‘out into the wild’. After a discussion with the course cohort, it’s apparent that taking a staggered approach to garner interest - a smoke test of the idea - is likely fruitless and wouldn’t do me much to further the offering. What I really want is for people to put their trust in me, pay to subscribe, and join me on the journey of building something in the open.</p>
<p>I’ll be sharing plenty more stories of ‘the road’ as I travel it but, for now, it’s eyes down to get <strong>something</strong> out and ready to sell this week!</p>
