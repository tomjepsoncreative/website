<h3>Summary</h3>
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>As I approach my 37th birthday I wanted to catalogue things that I picked up, learned, and thought about over the last 12 months and beyond. Some of this list is silly, some of it is not.<!-- Excerpt End --></p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>My wife has the patience of a saint (I already knew this but it never hurts to remind myself) and, without her support, I would be nowhere.</li>
<li>Going commando every now and again is oddly freeing.</li>
<li>Reading is, for now, one of the only activities I can truly engage with to achieve a state of flow.</li>
<li>Running my own business was inevitable.</li>
<li>I’m happier than I’ve been to go with the flow and assess opportunities as they happen.</li>
<li>I regret not talking to someone about my mental health a long time ago; a year of depression and anxiety medication has put me in a place where I could have been years before now.</li>
<li>I am still learning how to be kind.</li>
<li>I am still learning how to be patient.</li>
<li>I still know that I don’t really know what I want and that’s OK.</li>
<li>I can say I am now - more than ever - comfortable in who I am, flaws and all.</li>
<li>Presence matters to me even if I find it uncomfortable.</li>
<li>I value few luxuries more than a proper cup of coffee and a really good haircut.</li>
<li>The Marvel movies make my heart smile.</li>
<li>I have a growing entrepreneurial mindset.</li>
<li>Everything is a prototype, constantly in iteration.</li>
<li>I am still quite bad at finishing things.</li>
<li>Having pride in yourself and your work is OK.</li>
<li>It’s very difficult to allow a pause in a conversation to reach a point where its uncomfortable, despite it being necessary (sometimes).</li>
<li>The little things we do day to day in our work are more often than not the things that make a real difference to a project or client.</li>
<li>The little things are also really hard to codify and pass on to other people - they’re what make you you.</li>
<li>Going to the movies on my own is a rare treat but still a treat nevertheless.</li>
<li>The more you spend on a bottle of rum, the less of a hangover you get when you’ve enjoyed a little too much.</li>
<li>It’s hard to offer help well but it’s even harder to ask for it.</li>
<li>Running can actually be fun.</li>
<li>Doing nothing is sometimes better than doing something.</li>
<li>If I’m not willing to pay for something - a product, a workshop, a service - how could I expect someone else to?</li>
<li>I’m better than I think, even on the days when I don’t think I am.</li>
<li>There’s nothing more worrying when someone starts a project and says ‘I know exactly what we’re going to do!’.</li>
<li>UX design is one giant ball of ‘I don’t know’ and ‘It depends’ (Another thing I know but it never hurts to restate).</li>
<li>Success and progress can be achieved on your own but it’s way better when you involve your tribe.</li>
<li>Give me a quiet cocktail and a conversation over a crowded bar any day of the week (Literally; I never need an excuse!).</li>
<li>Learning how to disagree well is one of the most important skills anyone can ever learn.</li>
<li>Ideas aren’t worth anything until you act. Taking action doesn’t need to be costly or perfect; just <em>do something</em>.</li>
<li>You never know until you ask; it almost never hurts to ask.</li>
<li>Be responsive not reactive.</li>
<li>Network is everything.</li>
<li>It’s important to look after yourself above all else; if you’re down and out, how can you even begin to look after other people to the best of your abilities?</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s to another 37 years.</p>
