    <p>I recently took part in a roundtable discussion about Gen-Z and the future of the purpose-driven employment. It was enlightening. Being far from the ‘Gen-Z’ demographic, gaining insights into how this generation may think about work, about intention, about success ... it was a valuable conversation.

    <p>Distractions and context-switching (the act of jumping between tasks and snapping into different mental states) do not allow our mind the time and space it needs to quieten down, to focus, and to create work of meaning. It is stretching what we are capable of to breaking point.

    <p>In my line of work, disagreement is an inevitability. Disagreement over functions and features; over the distillation of user needs and wants; over strategic directions. It’s these disagreements and varieties of stance which help you reduce the risk of bias and give you and your team the best chance of creating a truly valuable solution to the problem you’re looking to solve.

    <p>From Wikipedia, ‘the term “future-proof” refers to the ability of something to continue to be of value into the distant future—that the item does not become obsolete.’ This infers that fear of obsolescence is a guiding principle for growth. I don't agree and, needless to say, I don’t believe in the term ‘future-proof’.

    <p>As digital product makers, our expectations of what constitutes a good experience are so advanced from 10, 15, 20 years ago that I don’t honestly believe we’re even looking at something cut from the same cloth. It might now be an amalgam of concepts learned along the way but we’ve come so far down a road, what we had is akin to Betamax next to todays’ streaming services.

    <p>‘Outstanding UX’ is no longer a USP for digital products. Putting user experience first is paramount in delivering value for your customers and for your business. Knowing the right problem to solve before you begin can unlock opportunities in your product that could save you time and money later.

    <p>The dictionary defines resilience as ‘the capacity to recover from difficulties’. It is what enables us to keep moving; it is toughness, strength. To be resilient is to face down the things which challenge us and say ‘not today’.

    <p>Taking stock of what we do as individuals running a business is paramount to us making progress and setting ourselves up for future success. As a company-of-one, it can be extremely easy to let the world pass by, moving from project to project, without really noticing where you started and where you’ve been.

    <p>As a UX designer, things such as videogames hold a wealth of knowledge that can be picked into. Seeing how the designers have worked to create 'peak moments' in a game and implement mechanics to both drive and impede your progress is deeply interesting. It can fuel the fire of my own creativity, showing new ways to create points of elevation or pride in a product outside of 'traditional gamification'.
